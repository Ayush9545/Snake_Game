# Snake_Game
This is Snake Game I have build with Java.

# Open World Snake Game 🐍

This is a basic version of the classic Snake game, created primarily to understand and demonstrate the core logic behind it. The project is still in its early stages and will evolve over time as I continue to learn and improve.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The long-term vision is to turn this into an **open-world Snake game** — where:

- The language should be Java only.
- The game doesn't end when the snake hits the wall (snake can pass through).
- The game only ends when the snake collides with itself.
- More engaging gameplay features will be added over time.

## 📌 Notes

Some of the above mechanics may change during development based on how they affect the gameplay experience. The aim is to strike a balance between fun, challenge, and innovation.
